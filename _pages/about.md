I love Linux, open-source, and technology in general.  

At work, I'm a jack-of-all-trades macOS systems administrator in the advertising industry. At home, I'm a passionate Linux enthusiast and aspiring Linux expert. I'm learning as I go, and I'll post here whenever I stumble upon something worth sharing.  

I'm not very active on social media, but feel free to email me or leave a comment if you want to get in touch. You'll likely receive a quick response as I jump on any opportunity to talk tech.  

Thanks and Happy Hacking!
