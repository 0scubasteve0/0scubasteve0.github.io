I"0<p>I love Linux, open-source, and technology in general.</p>

<p>At work, I’m a jack-of-all-trades macOS systems administrator in the advertising industry. At home, I’m a passionate Linux enthusiast and aspiring Linux expert. I’m learning as I go, and I’ll post here whenever I stumble upon something worth sharing.</p>

<p>This blog was built using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes">Minimal Mistakes</a> theme. All updates and tweaks can be followed on by GitHub repo linked in the sidebar.</p>

<p>I’m not very active on social media, but feel free to email me or leave a comment if you want to get in touch. You’ll likely receive a quick response as I jump on any opportunity to talk tech.</p>

<p>Thanks and Happy Hacking!</p>
