I"5<p>It doesn‚Äôt take long for me to get bored. I can only come home after work and watch Fraiser re-runs so many times before I get antsy- before I need a project.</p>

<p>It was this very need that drove me to begin what I‚Äôm dubbing ‚ÄúThe Linux Admin Project‚Äù. Over the next few months (or longer) I‚Äôm going to be completing a series of server builds, configurations, and excercies with the goal of making me a better Linux administrator.</p>

<p>My inspiration, in part, was this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/2s924h/how_did_you_get_your_start/cnnw1ma?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x">Reddit comment</a> by user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/IConrad">/u/IConrad</a>. According to the poster, if all steps in his list are completed, ‚Äúyou will be fully exposed to every aspect of Linux Enterprise systems administration.‚Äù After doing a lot of my own research and seeing his comment quoted on <a href="https://reddit.com/r/sysadmin">/r/sysadmin</a> more than once, I decided to use it as the foundation for this undertaking.</p>

<h3 id="some-background">Some Background</h3>

<p>Linux was first introduced to me in high school after I started tinkering with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus_Eee_PC">eeePC</a>: the cheap, tiny computer that would start the short-lived ‚ÄúNetbook‚Äù era (and eventually inspire Chromebooks). The whole idea of an alternative operating system fascinated me (‚Äúand they give it away for free?!?‚Äù) and soon enough I was trying to install it on everything.</p>

<p>After years of distro-hopping and repeatedly attempting to make Desktop Linux my daily driver, I finally made the full-time switch in 2015 and haven‚Äôt looked back. I‚Äôm currently running <a href="https://getsol.us/home/">Solus</a> on all my desktop systems, but most of my experience lies in Ubuntu and derivative distros.</p>

<p>Lately I‚Äôve had more opportunities to get my feet wet with Linux servers- maintaining a <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextlcoud</a> server for myself and some basic web-applications for work- and it‚Äôs made me more hungry to learn than ever before.</p>

<h3 id="the-homelab">The Homelab</h3>

<p>What‚Äôs any project if not an excuse to buy new hardware? Below is what I‚Äôll be working with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dell PowerEdge T30 Tower
    <ul>
      <li>Ubuntu 18.04 Server - <em>Chosen mainly for the built-in ZFS support, running KVM hypervisor</em></li>
      <li>Intel Xeon E3-1225 v5 3.3GHz Quad Core</li>
      <li>128GB Crucial SSD - <em>OS install</em></li>
      <li>(3) 4TB WD Red HDDs - <em>Configured in RAIDZ1 for fast and reliable VM storage</em></li>
      <li>16GB DDR4 ECC RAM</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ubiquiti EdgeRouter X</li>
  <li>Ubiquiti CloudKey Gen1</li>
  <li>Ubiquiti Unfifi AC-LR Access Point</li>
  <li>Raspberry Pi Model B - <em>Raspbian + PiHole</em> (I should update this to the Pi 4!)</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, I‚Äôve done some of the configuration already, but I‚Äôm planning on writing a future blog post on both KVM and ZFS configuration under Ubuntu. Ubiquiti and wireless networking won‚Äôt be a focus of this blog, but I‚Äôll probbably throw in a few bonus posts as I go.</p>

<h3 id="hows-my-driving">How‚Äôs my driving?</h3>

<p>Your feedback on my work is more than welcome- it is desperately needed! I‚Äôm an un-checked wannabe Linux admin with root privileges and I‚Äôm almost certainly going to wreck some servers before this is over, so if you see me doing something blatantly wrong or just irresponsible, please chime in! Leave comments below the posts or send me an <a href="mailto:ray@raylyon.net">email</a>, either way I‚Äôll definitely get back to you in short order. I‚Äôm happy to listen to critiques, answer questions, or just shoot the shit about Linux and tech. Let‚Äôs do this!</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and Happy Hacking!</p>
